# Welcome to Jumblejot.
Jumblejot is an web-based application that allows users to fine-tune their document editing experience. Jumblejot has created multiple innovative ways to create, edit, and share files. Using Jumblejot offers next-level elegance in code editing, due to its smooth design and easy-to use editors. The [Latapals](https://saco.dev) team is efficient in eliminating the need for clunky features, supplying our users with the cleanest experience in the web. 
### Easy Editor
Easy Editor is a feature within Jumblejot that offers the most integrated workflow in the editor. In the Easy Editor, you are full able to change the weight, leading, colour, and other formatting options when working with text. This opens a whole new world of beautiful writing and note-taking. Gain access to exclusive features and highly streamlined projects by using this feature when it is released. 
### Personalisation
Jumblejot offers advanced customization options, for the side of you that just wants to put their feet up and call Jumblejot home.

Within Jumblejot's settings, the user is able to adjust specific settings that can make the editor their own. For example, you are able to create your own colour schemes, change the background, change the size of text, the default font, etc. The list goes on. We are sick of apps that take away that ability and make you pay money for it. That's why we want to supply our users with an application that really feels like their own.
